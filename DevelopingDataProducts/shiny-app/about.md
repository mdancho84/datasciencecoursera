# Welcome to the Sales Analytics Dashboard

## Data

The data was simulated using a set of scripts I created as part of a side project called `orderSimulatoR`. The data simulation is intended to mimic real-world sales data for an organization. The data contains information related to customer orders such as order.id, products purchased, customer information (name and location), unit price, quantity sold, and so on. The simulated data was then used for analysis purposes as part of the __Sales Analytics Dashboard__. 

If your interested, the product names and prices came from the bicycle manufacturer, _[Cannondale](http://www.cannondale.com/en/USA)_, but the customer names and order details are all made up from the `orderSimulatoR` scripts. For more information on the data set, you can view my [orderSimulatoR blog post](http://www.mattdancho.com/business/2016/07/12/orderSimulatoR.html).

## How to Explore

There's a lot you can do with the __Sales Analytics Dashboard__. Here's a few suggestion to get started:

* Imagine you are an executive at _Cannondale_ in charge of strategy and business development. Your goal is to understand which products _Cannondale's_ customers are purchasing, which customers are purchasing the most, and what the organization can do to improve sales.

* Use the __Reactive Inputs__ to filter by year, product unit price, product primary category, and product secondary category. 

* On the __Analysis__ tab, see how the filters can be used to drill into the information. See if there are any insights that you can come up with from the data.

* Switch to the __Data__ tab to see how the filters control the data. Subset the data, and try downloading the csv file. 

* Use the __Reset Fields__ button when finished. See how the data set refreshs to its original size and how all of the reactive inputs
